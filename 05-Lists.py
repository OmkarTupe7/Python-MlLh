# List is more similar to arrays comapred to other programming languages

# If we have multiples of one kind of variable, we can use a list
# We can create a list with [square brackets], separating each value with commas

cities = ["Mumbai", "Navi-Mumbai"]
print(cities)

# We can add more to the cities simple by using append
cities.append("Wardha")
print(cities)

#If we want a specific city/replace from the list we can call/replace it by using indexes
print(cities[0])
